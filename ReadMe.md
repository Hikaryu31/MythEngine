## 3D PC Platform
Myth Engine is a game engine built to make 3D games on PC. It provides a number of tools to make its users work easier.

## Getting the engine
To get the engine you must get the [git project](https://gitlabstudents.isartintra.com/projets/2021_gp_2025_engine_gp_2025_engine-myth/-/tree/master/) and add the resources folder in MythEngine/Engine. This folder can be found on the [official drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vnxryTAJQrKdr_x0UtPqF2NLy1foQhhM) of the project as a .zip.

You should then compile the file MythEngine.sln that can be found in the MythEngine folder.

You can get either the editor version or the game version depending on which compilation configuration you use.

## Documentation and demos
The documentation can be found on the engine's GitHub repository.

A small game that serves as a technical demo can be accessed when the git project is pulled.
